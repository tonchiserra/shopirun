```

### Backup Feature
Commands with `make-backup-and-` prefix automatically create a timestamped backup of the selected theme before making changes. Backup themes are named with the format: `[Backup DD/MM] | Shopirun`

### Principal Commands
- **`start`** ‚Äì Start local development server with hot-reload and theme editor sync
- **`pull-all`** ‚Äì Pull all theme files from the store
- **`pull-jsons`** ‚Äì Pull only JSON files (templates, config, locales) without deleting existing files
- **`make-backup-and-deploy-all`** ‚Äì Create a timestamped backup and deploy all theme files
- **`deploy-all`** ‚Äì Deploy all theme files to the selected theme
- **`make-backup-and-deploy-without-jsons`** ‚Äì Create backup and deploy excluding JSON files
- **`deploy-without-jsons`** ‚Äì Deploy theme files excluding JSON configuration files

### Secondary Commands (via "Other" menu)
- **`pull-locales`** ‚Äì Pull only translation/locale files
- **`pull-templates`** ‚Äì Pull only template JSON files  
- **`pull-config`** ‚Äì Pull only settings_data.json configuration
- **`deploy-locales`** ‚Äì Deploy only locale/translation files
- **`deploy-templates`** ‚Äì Deploy only template JSON files
- **`deploy-config`** ‚Äì Deploy only settings_data.json
- **`deploy-jsons`** ‚Äì Deploy all JSON files (templates, config, locales)
- **`deploy-new`** ‚Äì Create and deploy as new unpublished theme

## Configuration

Create a `shopirun.config.json` file in your project root to streamline your workflow:

```json
{
    "store": "your-store.myshopify.com",
    "themes": {
        "staging": 123456789,
        "live": 987654321
    }
}
```

### Configuration Options
- **`store`** (string): Your Shopify store URL (automatically formats to .myshopify.com)
- **`themes`** (object, optional): Map custom theme names to their IDs for quick selection

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Skip store URL input on every command
- ‚úÖ Quick theme selection by name instead of entering IDs
- ‚úÖ Support for multiple environments (dev, staging, production)
- ‚úÖ Automatic error handling for missing or invalid configuration

If no configuration file is found, the CLI will prompt for required information and show a helpful reminder about creating the config file.

## Requirements
- Node.js >= 14
- Shopify CLI v3.x (automatically installed via `@shopify/cli` dependency)
- Access to a Shopify store and theme development permissions

## How It Works
Shopirun is a wrapper around the official Shopify CLI that provides:
- Simplified command structure with intuitive naming
- Interactive prompts for theme and store selection  
- Automatic backup creation before destructive operations
- Organized menu system separating principal and secondary commands
- Smart parameter handling and validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"Command not found"**: Ensure shopirun is installed globally with `-g` flag
- **Configuration errors**: Check that your `shopirun.config.json` has valid JSON syntax
- **Theme ID errors**: Verify theme IDs are numbers, not strings in the config file
- **Store access**: Ensure you're logged into Shopify CLI (`shopify auth login`)

### Getting Help
Run `shopirun` to access the interactive menu system.
